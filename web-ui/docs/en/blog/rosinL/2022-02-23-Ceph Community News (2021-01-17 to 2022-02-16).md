## Recently Merged PRs
Recently,  PRs have mainly focused on bug fixing. The following describes notable changes:
- mgr: Disabled the pg recovery by default when OSD is in or out. You can manually enable it as required to reduce the impact on the service cluster. [pr#44588](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44588)
- osd: Added the dump_blocked_ops_count option to ceph daemon perf dump to quickly obtain the number of blocked ops, reducing the overhead caused by the dump_blocked_ops operation. [pr#44780](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44780)
- rgw: Added support for the conditional copy by the rgw s3 CopyObject interface. [pr#44678](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44678)
- rgw: Fixed the issue that a large amount of memory is used during the radosgw-admin bucket chown process. [pr#44357](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44357)
- rbd: Introduced the rxbounce option to krbd to solve the problem of CRC errors and performance deterioration when images are used as block devices of the Windows system. [pr#44842](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44842)
## Recent Ceph Developer News
Each module of the Ceph community holds regular meetings to discuss and align the development progress. Meeting videos are uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCno-Fry25FJ7B4RycCxOtfw/videos). The major meetings are as follows:
|Meeting|Description|Frequency|
|-------|----|----|
|Crimson SeaStore OSD Weekly Meeting |Crimson & SeaStore development|Weekly|
|Ceph Orchestration Meeting|Ceph management module (mgr) development|Weekly|
|Ceph DocUBetter Meeting |Document optimization|Biweekly|
|Ceph Performance Meeting|Ceph performance optimization|Biweekly|
|Ceph Developer Monthly|Ceph developers|Monthly|
|Ceph Testing Meeting|Version verification and release|Monthly|
|Ceph Science User Group Meeting|Ceph scientific computing|Irregularly|
|Ceph Leadership Team Meeting|Ceph leadership team|Weekly|

Recently, the community focuses on the freeze test and verification of the Quincy version. The following topics are discussed at the meetings:
- In the Quincy version test, the read performance meets the expectation, but the write performance deteriorates in some scenarios. It can be determined that 4k min_alloc_size and bluestore allocator can improve the performance.
- As the omap scale increases, the omap_iterator efficiency causes a large number of slow_ops or even no response. The [issue](https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/53926) records the test results of the two compaction modes. If the compaction is manually triggered, the latency cannot be restored to the previous level. To resolve this issue, Rocksdb provides [periodic and TTL compaction](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Tuning-Guide#periodic-and-ttl-compaction). After this function is enabled, the latency can be restored to the previous level.
- A large number of PRs are merged for the Ceph Benchmark Tool (CBT) with a focus on the control of memory resources during the large-scale OSD test and the multi-client concurrent test cases.
