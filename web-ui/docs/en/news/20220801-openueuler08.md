## Community Governance

</div><br>

### Community Council

- The Secretariat Office drafted the *openEuler Ecological Innovation Center Authorization Management Method*, which starts implementation after it was reviewed and approved by the Council.  

- The Secretariat Office took the lead in setting up the *openEuler Authorization Process and Management Regulations for Talent Assessment Organizations*, which was reviewed and approved by the Council.  

### **21 New Organizations** Joined

**New members:** Agilor, Yichang Zhimanfen, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Fujian BossSoft, SITONHOLY, Shanghai MT Networks, Data Pipeline, Chengdu Iamidata, Shanghai AISHU, Chengdu GhostCloud, INTROPYTECH, Greater Bay Area National Technology Innovation Center, Suzhou AMAX, INNOSILICON, SinoRail (Beijing), Sichuan GoldKey, Chinasoft International (Shenzhen), Liuheyuanjiao (Chengdu), Hualongxunda, and China Unitechs

## Technology Development

</div><br>

### openEuler SIG Meetings

To facilitate SIG members' participation, the community website demonstrates the scheduled SIG meetings on the official website. SIG meetings are open to all members, so you can share your ideas and get feedback from others. For those who missed the meeting, minutes are provided as well.  

### openEuler Porting Guide

When porting to openEuler, problems are sometimes inevitable. Hardware and software compatibility, system environment restoration, and system performance needs are frequent concerns of our partners.  

For quicker porting and better performance, the community drafted the ***openEuler Porting Guide*** (English version coming soon). This guide provides tools for compatibility evaluation, analysis, and testing, as well as porting cases of major applications.  

### openEuler Resource Utilization Improvement

Several studies indicate that DC clusters use less than 20% of their CPUs, wasting many resources. To address this issue, Cloud Native SIG, High Performance Network SIG, Kernel SIG, OpenStack SIG, and Virt SIG have teamed up to discuss technologies for improving DC resource utilization. If you are interested, search for the preceding SIGs in [openEuler SIG List](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-list/) and join them.  

### StratoVirt vNIC Implementation

Currently, the StratoVirt supports three types of vNICs: Virtio-net, Vhost-net, and Vhost-user-net. Each type has its own pros and cons. You can select any type based on different needs.  

Virtio-net: Average performance needs

Vhost-net: High performance needs and low CPU resources

Vhost-user-net: High performance needs and high CPU resources

###  LibcarePlus User-mode Hot Patch

At the beginning of July, the openEuler community cooperated with the e-Cloud infrastructure technical team to build the LibcarePlus hot patch function that fully supports the AArch 64 and x86 platforms. It can be used to fix CVE vulnerabilities or emergency bugs while at the same time application services still run perfectly. As a key technology of the openEuler community, LibcarePlus user-mode hot patch has always been a hot topic since its release.   

Currently, LibcarePlus has been open-sourced in the openEuler community. The SIG team will share their tech details and feature updates in the future.  

[Project repo](https://gitee.com/openeuler/libcareplus)

### openEuler Mini Courses Jointly Developed by the G11N SIG and Kernel SIG

For a better understanding of the openEuler OS, the G11N and Kernel SIGs are developing a series of mini courses to explain kernel-related concepts. Two episodes have been released: [openEuler Mini Video Courses 01 – Kdump](https://www.openeuler.org/en/blog/zhangweiyu/2022-07-13-openEuler-Mini-Video-Courses-Kdump.html) and [openEuler Mini Video Courses 02 – Linux PCI Subsystem](https://www.openeuler.org/en/blog/zhangweiyu/2022-07-13-openEuler-Mini-Video-Courses-Linux %20PCI %20subsystem.html). More exciting courses will be released soon.  

If you are interested in this series, you can [Join the G11N and Kernel SIGs](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-list/) for further discussion.  

### CVE

The community fixed 66 vulnerabilities in July, including 9 critical and 31 high-risk ones. Learn more [here](https://www.openeuler.org/en/security/cve/).  

<div align='center'>

## Infrastructure

</div><br>

For developers, community infrastructure has always been of interest and concern. To improve user experience, we made the following updates.  

### openEuler Official Website

 

1. To make the official website clearer and more concise, we redesigned the web content and layout. The environment experience, porting zone, and case center are preferentially displayed.  

  [Porting zone](https://www.openeuler.org/en/other/migration)

2. [Case Center (English version coming soon)](https://new.openeuler.org/zh/showcase/): More than 10 user cases are added, covering finance, carrier, energy, logistics, and many more sectors.  

3. Enabled global CDN acceleration to improve access performance outside China.  

4. Optimized the web search, and fixed search errors and search hit failures.  

### Mirror Sites

Three mirror sites in Europe are added (France, Austria, and Belgium) so that European users can download and use the mirror sites for better experience. For details, see [Mirrors](https://www.openeuler.org/en/mirror/list/).

</div><br>

### MoocStudio

The VM environment is supported.

Currently, this function is available only in the course ***openEuler Playground: Experiencing openEuler via Web Browser***

For details, visit [MoocStudio](https://moocstudio.openeuler.sh/#/course/playground).  

### Community Widgets

To help community developers share code while protecting privacy, the infrastructure team launched the code sharing service based on the open-source project PrivateBin. The project supports various formats such as text, Markdown, and source code, and allows password protection, private links, maximum retention period, email sending, dynamic QR code, and one-piece copy.

## Community Activities

</div><br>

On July 14, the openEuler community operations team organized the first roast event: **openEuler Talk**. We are honored to invite TC members Xiong Wei and Cao Zhi as the main roasters, attracting more than 40 maintainers to participate in the discussion.  

Developers reported 13 issues during the event, covering documents, blogs, new developer experience, and community maintainer experience.
